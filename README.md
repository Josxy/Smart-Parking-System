# Smart Parking System
## Terminology and Concepts
Definition: 

* **Goal** 
Goal this project is to simulate Smart Parking System that monitor parking space availability and inform users about lot avaliability.
* **Random variables**
* Number of vehicles enter at a time
* Number of vehicles exit at a time
* How much time spent parked for each vehicle
* **System State** 
* Number of filled and unfilled lots
* Assignment status of parking slot
* Queue length at enterence
* List of vehicles on waiting line
* List of vehicles assigned
* **Entitites** 
* Parking lot
* Vehicles
* Sensors
* **Events:**
* Enter of new vehicle
* Exit of parked vehicle (bundan emin degilim disardan gelmicek bu timerla calisicak zaten ama bilemedim)
* Malfunction on sensors collect avaliability data from lot
* **Activities**
* Parking duration
* offline malfunction fix duration
* **Delay:**
* Time waiting for a slot to become available
* Vehicle waiting in queue due to full lot or sensor malfunction
## Components
???
### Time Advance Algorithm
Event-scheduling approach (variable time advance)
**Future Evenets**
* **Arrival event:**??
* **Service completion event:**??
* **Stopping event:**?? kalani anlamadim bunlari rapora mi koymaliyiz buraya mi

## Simulation Program

## Verification and Validation
